I am known as Choon Yin Yeap in Australia. Have you ever wondered why it is spelt this way? What’s the story behind my name? No, I am not Choon; my first name is Choon Yin. My last name is Yeap. Sometimes I concatenate my first name as Choonyin or hyphenate it as Choon-Yin to avoid being addressed as Choon. My friends endearingly call me CY; if they were roasting me, they’d call me CYY…Y, adding more Ys depending on how bad the story is going to be.

Are you Korean? Um… no.

I am known as Yeap Choon Yin in Malaysia, that’s on my birth certificate. I am of Chinese ethnicity. Fortunately, unlike in many countries, Chinese in Malaysia can use their Chinese names even though I am third-generation Malaysian. Why isn’t it romanised using Pinyin? Pinyin was not the mainstream romanisation system for Mandarin when I was born; the system that was popular was called Wade–Giles. Some of the most famous people who had Wade–Giles-romanised Chinese names were Lee Kuan Yew, Sun Yat-sen, and Wu Lien-teh (who pioneered the modern surgical mask).

My Chinese name is 叶 (ye) 春 (chun) 樱 (ying). 叶 (ye) is my family name, which means ‘leaf’; 春 (chun) means the spring season—no, I wasn’t born in spring in either hemisphere; 樱 (ying) means 'cherry blossoms'. Translated literally, my name is the leafy spring cherry blossom tree.

I hope this satisfies your curiosity. :)

I’ve decided to take a one- or two-year career break after a decade of working as a software engineer. This site is my running log of travel diaries, personal reflections, and explorations in philosophy during my career break, when I finally don’t have an excuse not to write.
