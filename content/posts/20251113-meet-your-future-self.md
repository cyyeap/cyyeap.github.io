title: 'Meet Your Future Self'
---

I've had more than a dozen of meditation sessions so far. 
The only level of consciousness I could achieve through meditation prior my trips to Bali was I could focus on my inhalation and my exhalation, nothing more than that. Of course, I could achieve a level of calmness after those sessions, that were my understanding meditation -- nothingness and stillness.

My partner and I did a sound healing session at the Serendipity Sounds Meditation with Janice. It was our first ever meditation together, and I chose the best rated one on Google. It was five stars. Both of us were skeptical about it'd work on us (Thanks to our ego.) I did go into a deeper level of my consciousness that I'd never got into. 

Then a few people before and during our first Bali trip suggested that we should give Watsu (water healing) a go. Here's another time I got into a deeper level of my consciousness. It's a shallower, the one at the sound healing session was deeper. 

Then in this Yoga retreat, I couldn't really focus on regular meditation session like my brain kept wondering, and the only session that I found it to be working was the session which the instructor were playing Tibetan sound. I realised the common factor, it's always sound.

I saw on **小红书** (the red note) app that people rave about the "Meet Your Future Self" session by Leah Cruz at the Yoga Barn and I thought I gave it a trial. It's really nothing that metaphysical about it, as it's a guided meditation that guide you into a deeper level consciousness with sound bowls. I managed to **talk** to my future self (like subscious thought). I wouldn't write what I saw as it's very personal.

Funnily, I've been binge watching the Queen of News **新闻女王** Season 2. One of the topics was a cult group, and what I see here in Ubud -- highly commercialised spiritual activities show some ressemblence. It's a reminder to myself if it's working -- it's still important to be grounded and be objective on the over the top spiritual beliefs. A line shouldn't be crossed.
