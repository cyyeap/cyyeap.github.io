I've had more than a dozen meditation sessions so far.
The only level of consciousness I could achieve through meditation prior to my trips to Bali was the ability to focus on my inhalation and exhalation. Nothing more than that. Of course, I could achieve a level of calmness after those sessions; that was my understanding of meditation: nothingness and stillness.

My partner and I did a sound healing session purely out of curiosity at Serendipity Sounds Meditation with Janice. It was our first-ever meditation together, and I chose the best-rated one on Google. It had five stars. Both of us were skeptical it would work on us (thanks to our egos). I went into a deeper level of consciousness than I had ever reached before in my meditation practice. My partner could also experience something different and could reproduce the same effect when we went there the second time.

Then a few people, before and during our first trip to Bali, suggested that we give *Watsu* (water healing) a go. That was another time I reached a deeper level of consciousness. It was shallower; the one at the sound healing session was deeper.

Then, in this yoga retreat, I couldn't really focus during regular meditation sessions; my brain kept wandering, and the only session I found to be effective was the one in which the instructor was playing Tibetan sounds. I realised the common factor: it's always sound.

I saw on *小红书* (Little Red Book) that people rave about the “Meet Your Future Self” session by Leah Cruz at the Yoga Barn, and I thought I'd give it a try. The class was full, in a beautiful classroom overlooking a beautifully curated Balinese landscape and supplied with high-quality meditation tools. There's really nothing too metaphysical about it, as it's a guided meditation that leads you into a deeper level of consciousness with sound bowls, likely using some hypnosis methods. I managed to talk to my future self (I think it was my subconscious). I won't write what I saw here, as it's very personal.

Funnily enough, I've been binge-watching The Queen of News *新闻女王* Season 2. One of the topics was a cult group, and what I see here in Ubud i.e., highly commercialised spiritual activities, bears some resemblance. The episode was well-researched and well-executed, mentioning concepts commonly used in esoteric philosophy and spiritualism, e.g., the Akashic Records, the law of attraction, and connecting to the higher self. The reporter later found that the believers were under the influence of psychological manipulation and illegal drugs.

It's a reminder to myself that even if it's working, it's still important to be grounded and objective about over-the-top spiritual beliefs. It's important to be skeptical and moderate in my beliefs and apply critical thinking where possible. :)
