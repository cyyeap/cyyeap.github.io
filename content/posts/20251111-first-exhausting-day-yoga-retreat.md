title: 'First Exhausting Day Yoga Retreat'
---



Today, it's particularly exhausting. Unlike previous days during our free time, we relaxed in our air-conditioned room, today, Lydia and I decided togo to Ubud Central to get `bebek` (duck) at Warung Sun Sun for lunch. It's Lydia's first time having `bebek` in Bali, and I had a good experience eating `bebek` there so decided to take her there. Traffic in Ubud is notoriously bad as there are probably less than 3 traffic lights in total, it's worse when there are local ceremonies happening around the area where the roads are blocked for ceremonial purposes.Today, it's one of those days with blocked roads. It took us about an hour to get to Warung Sun Sun from our yoga retreat, our Grab driver to there was particularly impatient. 

 As soon as we sat down at our table, there was a massive downpour. Unlike modern restaurants, Warung Sun Sun requires the guests to be shoeless before sitting down on a table, we left our shoes on a shoe rack, and with a small umbrella covered. With this downpour, you can imagine there are rain splash to our shoes. `Bebek Baker` (grilled duck) at Warung Sun Sun was approved by Lydia. So it's all worth it. We're soaked with the rain going to be in the car again. Very abuden-ly, the traffic is bad again. The grab driver was extremely chatty in a good way -- he recommended a Lombok cuisine called ayam talipung, and I learnt that he has 2 daughters and 1 son. The daughters have 1 child each, and in total he has 2 cucu (grandchildren). I was gladly I could practice the local indonesian language with him, and I guess that explains today it's particularly draining as for introvert. The journey was an hour, and he talked the whole way in a language I don't normally converse in.

Today it's day 3 of the 7 day yoga retreat, it's the first day where there are 3 yoga sessions. So it also explains why it's particularly exhausting. 

This is the daily schedule:
7:30 - 9:30 am | meditation / yoga 
9:30 - 10:30 am | breakfast 
10:30 - 11:30 am |  workshop / yoga 
11:30 am - 4:30 pm | free time 
4:30 am - 6:30 pm | yoga 
6:30 pm | dinner 


Today, I tried Yin Yoga for the first time (no it didn't name after me :p). 
I surprisingly loved it. It's very relaxing, and it ends with tibetan sound bath recorded from audio, so i thought I had to pay someone to play the sound bath for me to have deep meditation, to my surprise, if it's from audio recording it works.

As today, I'm particularly exhausting. I wrote this post out of coherance and full of typos, so I had ChatGPT to correct to coherance for my readerrs won't suffer that much.
