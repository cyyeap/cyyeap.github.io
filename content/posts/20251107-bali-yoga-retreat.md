Lydia and I started our Bali trip staying in Denpasar for the first night.
As the regular CY's fashion, I booked the stay the night before departure without doing much research relying based on the number of rating. It was 9.3 stars out of 10 stars on booking.com with a N number of reviews. N = CY's acceptable value. 

It's now during the moonsoon season in Bali. Our flight arrived in Denpasar at 7pm, as the sun had already set. I coped the acoomodation address from booking.com and put it on the destination location on Grab. As soon as we arrived the homestay, there was a downpour. I sent a screenshot of the Google Map of the address to the host asking if we're going to the right address, and the address I typed were close but not quite, it should turn right after `Bali Guling Golden` instead of the address.

Usually, it wasn't a convenience as often we could the accomodation would be within reach even with a heavy suitcase.

It's a night with heavy rain, and the Grab driver dropped us in front of `Babi Guling Golden`. Luckily, both Lydia and I were prepared for downpour with an umbrella. Also the first time in a long time I'm glad that I'm bringing a suitcase instead of a non-waterproof backpack. For the past years, as long as I am not traveling to cold countries I'd only carry a backpack regardless how long I go. 

Also, interestingly enough, I genuinely couldn't remember a time when I arrived at an acoomodation it's a heavy rain. Anyways, we look like the family in the begining scene of Crazy Rich Asians, where Michelle Yeoh and Co. reached the hotel in London they're completely wet. 

As we arribed the homestay, we thought it's definitely worth the 9.3 rating. And we went to have the best Bali Guling I've ever had in my life (okay, I only had 3 so far! :)), it's just ~$2.5 for regular Bali Guling.

Closing the midnight, the football field still had loud noise speakers from shouting yelling instructions then motorbikes were roaring after midnight where presumbly the parents were picking their kids.
