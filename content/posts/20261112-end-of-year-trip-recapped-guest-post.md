Guest post from my partner: 

In about 36 hours, CYY and I will be flying home from our latest trip to Asia. We’ll have flown 19,824km on this trip, and a few hundred more by high-speed rail around China. That might sound like a lot of travel, but I did 173,337km in 2025 and CYY did 124,437km. CYY often asks me “what did you learn?” She never specifies over what time frame, or with respect to what topic so it can be a rather open-ended question. In this blog post, I’ll share my lessons from this trip. In no particular order, I learned:


* Shanghai is a really nice city - probably my favourite in China (I’ve been to 5-10 now)
* Pork is tasty when it’s small and spicy. Chinese are better chefs than the British.
* That if I ever travel back in time to the Qin dynasty, it’s apparently quite easy to install a fake king on the throne. 
* Cinemas can be quite a different experience in other countries.
    * In Malaysia, expect a good deal of the screen real estate to be taken up by subtitles in three languages. 
    * Also expect popcorn to be the best you’ve ever had and the seating options to be better than anywhere else in the world. We even watched Avatar on reclining beds (the cinema is sponsored by a mattress company). 
    * It’s not all good though, it was a surprising pain in the butt to even purchase the tickets: couldn’t do it online, and could barely do it in-person, as you had to tap twice at just the right time for the purchase to go through - and if you failed, you had to wait for the 5 minute timeout to pass. 
* In China, on the other hand, expect a mix of regular popcorn and something that I can only explain as “popped fries”. Imagine regular French fries, but they’ve been “popped” in the same way that happens to a corn kernel: so they’re grown to three times the size and mostly hollow. Good? Debatable. Innovation? Definitely. 
    * Chinese cities are free to innovate on what constitutes mandatory security at railway stations.
    * Some will want to scan your water bottle very attentively. 
    * Some will do a cursory job of pretending to scan them. 
    * …and some seem downright confused about why you’re offering them your water bottle.
* They also vary in their level of tech-savviness. Shanghai seems to allow paying by Apple Pay (though I never tried this) and will tell you when the next train is down to the second. It subjectively feels like waiting less time when you’re watching that timer.
* Taobao is both much better and much worse at logistics than Amazon. I got to experience this twenty-two times over, once for every package that CYY ordered. I think some of this is downstream of relative wages. E.g. Taobao has the ability to track the individual truck your deliveries are on, but on the other hand deliveries are just an absolute jumble of individually-packaged items. From what I can see, it’s up to the individual driver to sort out who gets what on the side of the street - what a pain that must be! (and error prone too?)
* The key to getting from 95% fulfilment in life to 100% is having new plastic contraptions in exactly the right shapes.
* Shanghai is a big place. The Bund is not the West Bund, they’re nowhere near each other and the vibe is completely different. The French concession area is really nice and CYY did a great job by picking a hotel in that area (even if it had no windows)
* Chinese dogs are surprisingly clever. Of all the dogs I saw crossing the road without a human present, 100% were at pedestrian crossings. Admittedly it was when the light was red, but I can hardly blame the dogs when they’re colour-blind (and, y’know, dogs)
* I need to focus on ensuring that my destination is equally as correct as my route-following when navigating, or I might as well not be navigating at all.
* The only people who wanted to speak English to me on this trip were people pulling some kind of odd scam.. or just odd? One guy insisted on spraying some cleaning liquid on my shoe and rubbing it off for free. I should have walked away, but I was just too puzzled to form a response at first.
* Likewise, no one called me beautiful on this trip, nor complimented me on my command of the English language. Clearly people in Sichuan and Tibet provinces have the superior taste.
* China is the first time in my adult life someone has tried to convert me to Christianity. It wasn’t very successful (what with the language barrier and all), but CYY had to listen to him drone on for our twenty minute car trip. I turned on live translation and read it dutifully out of a sense of solidarity. 
* Chinese massage is not nearly as harm free as Balinese massage. I ended up with bruises on about 10-15% of my back by the end of it. The masseuse tells me it’s because I have a bad stomach.
* The Hilton in Kuala Lumpur has truly excellent breakfast. Free breakfast thanks to Amex is a genuinely valuable perk. I can’t wait to be disappointed by whichever Hilton I attend next that fails to meet this new standard.
