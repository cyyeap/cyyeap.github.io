Today was particularly exhausting. Unlike previous days when, during our free time, we relaxed in our air-conditioned room, today Lydia and I decided to go to Ubud Central to get *bebek* (duck) at *Warung* (restaurant) Sun Sun for lunch. It was Lydia's first time having *bebek* in Bali, and I’d had a good experience eating it there, so I decided to take her.

Traffic in Ubud is notoriously bad, as there are probably fewer than three traffic lights in total; it’s worse when there are local ceremonies and roads are blocked for ceremonial purposes. Today was one of those days with blocked roads. It took us about an hour to get to Sun Sun from our yoga retreat; our Grab driver on the way there was particularly impatient, honking and sighing the whole way.

As soon as we sat down at our table, a massive downpour began. Unlike modern restaurants, Sun Sun requires guests to be shoeless before sitting at a table. We left our shoes on a rack, covered by a small umbrella. With the downpour, you can imagine there was rain splashing onto our shoes. *Bebek bakar* (grilled duck) at Sun Sun got Lydia’s approval, so it was all worth it.

We decided to head back to the yoga retreat straightaway. We were soaked by the rain before getting in the car again. Very [abuden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuRhT2TqEUE)-ly, the traffic was bad again. The Grab driver was extremely chatty in a good way — he recommended a Lombok dish called *ayam talipung*, and I learned that he has two daughters and one son. The daughters have one child each, and in total he has two *cucu* (grandchildren). I was glad I could practice the local Indonesian language with him, and I guess that explains why today was particularly draining for the introverted me. The journey was an hour, and he talked the whole way in a language I don’t normally converse in.

Today is day 3 of the 7-day yoga retreat; it’s the first day with three yoga sessions. That also explains why today’s particularly exhausting.

This is the daily schedule:

| Time             | Activity          |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 7:30–9:30 am     | meditation / yoga |
| 9:30–10:30 am    | breakfast         |
| 10:30–11:30 am   | workshop / yoga   |
| 11:30–4:30 pm | free time         |
| 4:30–6:30 pm     | yoga              |
| 6:30 pm          | dinner            |

Today I tried Yin Yoga for the first time (no, it isn’t named after me :p). I loved it. Unlike other types of yoga, it’s more passive and less intense for unfit people like myself. It’s very relaxing, and it ends with a Tibetan sound bath from a recording. I used to think I had to pay someone to play a sound bath IRL for deep meditation; to my surprise, an audio recording works too!
