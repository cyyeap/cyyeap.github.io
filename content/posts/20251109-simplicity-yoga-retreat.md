I left Bali exactly one month ago. I resigned from my job two days later upon my return in Melbourne. Two days after my last day at work, I decided to go back to Bali. 

Sometimes, life is pretty funny. I've traveled to a lot of places, and have a long wishlist on where to go next. Bali has never been a place that I wanted to visit. One of my ex partners had painted that Bali would be his last place to visit. 

 A wedding invitation changed that. My goddaughter's parents decided to have a wedding at the Apurva Kempinski in Bali after ~ 7 years being registered as married couple. The wedding was beautiful, and it was my first overseas wedding invitation, gladly took the chance to travel.

 Usually when my partner and I traveled to a country, we would only stay at one city like 1-2 days. Utilising my excellent research skills, I decided to go to Ubud first with the ambition to travel around the island. After 3 days, we decided that we loved Ubud so much we decided to stay for another day, okay and another 2 days, and another 2 days. So in total we stayed in Ubud for 7 days out of 10 days of our trip. In Ubud, we took the chance to experience various spiritual endevours from watsu (water healing) to the free classes at the School of Unified Healing. We were surprised for how much we love the experiences. 

 Shortly after my return to Melbourne from Bali and after ny resignation, my neighbour asked if I wanted to be a sound healing model for her student who just took a class taught by her. Gladly accepted. I was asked to pick a card from a deck of cards (I suspect they're Balinese blessing cards.), the card I picked was `Simplicity`. I didn't think much of it, just thought cool. 

 Then it came to the first day of the yoga retreat in Bali, I was asked to pick a card from the deck of Balinese blessing cards. In my inner voice, I thought it surely didn't matter, then I patiently waited almost had their turn. Guess what..the card I picked up was again `Simplicity`. Embarassingly, I didn't know the probability on top of my head, after brushing up my statistics on demand, it's about $1/50 so 2% chance. 

 The universal again reminds me that I need to embrace simplicity, so I'll end this post here to keep this simple. :)
