I left Bali exactly one month ago. Two days after returning to Melbourne, I resigned from my job. Two days after my last day at work, I was back in Bali. 

Sometimes, life is pretty funny. I've traveled to a lot of places and have a long wishlist of where to go next. Bali had never been a place I wanted to visit.

A wedding invitation changed that. My goddaughter's parents decided to have a wedding at the Apurva Kempinski in Bali after ~7 years of being registered as a married couple. The wedding was beautiful, and it was my first overseas wedding invitation. I gladly took the chance to travel.

Usually, when my partner and I traveled to a country, we would only stay in one city for 1–2 days. Utilizing my excellent research skills, I decided to go to Ubud first with the ambition to travel around the island. After three days, we decided that we loved Ubud so much we would stay for another day—okay, and another two days, and another two days. So, in total, we stayed in Ubud for 7 of the 10 days of our trip. In Ubud, we took the chance to experience various spiritual endeavours, from watsu (water healing) to the free classes at the School of Unified Healing. We were surprised by how much we loved the experiences, and actually worked on us.

Shortly after my return to Melbourne from Bali and after my resignation, my neighbour asked if I wanted to be a sound healing model (yay for being a model for the first time) for her student who had just taken a class she taught. I gladly accepted. I was asked to pick a card from a deck (I suspect they were Balinese blessing cards) on that day of being a model. The card I picked was Simplicity. I didn't think much of it—just thought, “cool.”

Then, on the first day of the yoga retreat in Bali, I was asked to pick a card from a deck of Balinese blessing cards. My inner voice said it surely didn't matter, and I patiently waited while almost everyone had their turn. Guess what… the card I picked was again Simplicity. Embarrassingly, I didn't know the probability off the top of my head; after brushing up my statistics on demand, it's 2% chance.

The universe again reminds me that I need to embrace simplicity, so I'll end this post here to keep it simple. :)
