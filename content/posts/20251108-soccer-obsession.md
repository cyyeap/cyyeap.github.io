Lydia and I started our Bali trip by staying in Denpasar for the first night.
In typical CY fashion, I booked the stay the night before departure without doing much research, relying on the rating alone. It was 9.3 out of 10 on Booking.com with N reviews. N = CY's acceptable value.

It's monsoon season in Bali. Our flight arrived in Denpasar at 7 pm, as the sun had already set. I copied the accommodation address from Booking.com and set it as the destination in Grab. As soon as we arrived at the homestay, there was a downpour. I sent a screenshot of the Google Maps address to the host, asking if we were going to the right address, and the address I typed was close but not quite; we should have turned right after Bali Guling Golden, restaurant specialising in local Balinese crispy pork.

Usually, it wasn't a concern, as often the accommodation would be within reach even with a heavy suitcase.

It was a night of heavy rain, and the Grab driver dropped us in front of Babi Guling Golden. Luckily, both Lydia and I were prepared for the downpour with umbrellas in our bags. It was also the first time in a long time I was glad I was bringing a suitcase instead of a non-waterproof backpack. For the past few years, as long as I wasn't traveling to cold countries, I'd carry only a backpack, regardless of how long I was going.

Also, interestingly enough, I genuinely couldn't remember a time when I arrived at an accommodation in heavy rain. Anyway, we looked like the family in the opening scene of _Crazy Rich Asians_, where Michelle Yeoh and co. reach the hotel in London completely soaked.

As we arrived at the homestay, we thought it was definitely worth the 9.3 rating. Then as we're pretty hangry, we went to Warung Babi Guling Golden, and it's the best Bali guling I've ever had in my life (okay, I've only had three so far). It was just ~$2.50 for a regular Bali guling.

Close to midnight, the football field still had loudspeakers blaring with shouted instructions, then motorbikes were roaring after midnight, presumably as parents were picking up their kids.

Finally, a quiet time began. Then the rain started pouring again; the homestay was made of wood, so you can imagine the sound insulation was not up to modern standards.

Earplugs on, I slept in. Then I was woken up by noise from the football field again. Looking at the time on my phone, it was 7 am! I guess the Balinese really love football.
